Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into different groups based on their shopping behavior. In this project, we used RFM analysis—Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value—to understand customer habits.

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency: How often they purchased

Monetary: How much they spent

After calculating RFM values for each customer, we applied the KMeans Clustering algorithm to group similar customers together. This helped us identify valuable customer segments like loyal buyers, high spenders, and inactive users.

Such segmentation is very useful for businesses to create personalized marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
